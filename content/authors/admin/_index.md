Hi! I am Eden Belouadah, an ML Research Scientist at Datakalab. I have 5 years of experience working on continual learning for image classification and object detection. At Datakalab, I am part of the context adaptation team. Our goal is to compress large object detection models and deploy them on the edge. I previously worked on fall detection and continuous optimization. Currently, I am also working on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Stable Diffusions..
